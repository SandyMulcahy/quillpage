# quillpage
A prototype staff page for quillproject.net
Microinternship December 2025

Possible Changes to the DB structure:

- Add 'project_partners' field to library_groups, to link institutions like UVU to specific projects. 
    this would allow partner section to update when new library button is clicked
    also could implement the hovering institution effect on the project contributors with this

- Split the field 'editors' in conventions DB into smaller categories 'editors', 'coeditors', 'contributors'
    the project contributor cards could then match the Figma design, displaying each person's role as well.

- Add contributors to the Australian Constitution Library (currently there are none in the json)
