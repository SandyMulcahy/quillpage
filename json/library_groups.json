Our cutting-edge visualisations allow users a more thorough understanding of the context within which key decisions were made, the origins of certain constitutional provisions, and how the negotiations were structured. The collection was made possible by a generous Digital Advancement Grant from the National Endowment For the Humanities.",
    "introduction_text": "Unlike the Federal Convention, the records of the state constitutional conventions of the US have been little studied and analysed. These states in particular—North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming and Idaho—were chosen for the project because they are still in effect today (albeit in amended forms). They shed light on a particular moment in state constitutional history, when the territories of the American West were vying for statehood. Four of them began on the 4th of July, with Wyoming’s constitutional convention commencing at the beginning of September. \r\n\r\nThese digital models were predominantly constructed using the official Convention records, with supplementary sources such as newspapers consulted to fill in gaps in the record. Scans of all of these materials, including many boxes worth of state archival material that has not been previously digitised, have been incorporated into the model as ‘resource collections’. The full collection was published in September 2023. Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the web resources generated by this project, do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities.",

    "description": "Writing Peace is an initiative of the Quill Project in Pembroke College and the Faculty of History at Oxford University, in collaboration with partners in Ireland and the US, to create a rounded view of the  peace talks in Northern Ireland from the late 1980s to early 2000s. Online resource collections and cutting-edge analytical tools celebrate the constellation of peace makers involved and help scholars and practitioners alike to learn lessons for the future.",
    "introduction_text": "Writing Peace offers a unique collection and visualization of primary source material relating to the peace process, allowing users to understand the context within which key decisions and compromises were made, the origins of particular phrases, and the developing roles of individuals and political parties. \r\nThe  model at the heart of the project is constructed by taking official accounts and papers  and using them to create a ‘spine’ in the software platform around which the digital edition is constructed. Unofficial sources, private papers and correspondence, and later recollections are presented as a secondary layer of material around this core. It is hoped that links to relevant public briefings, oral history and media archives will also be added over time. This layering enables us to build multiple perspectives into the model even at an early stage when we are working primarily from a single archive, but it is also sufficiently flexible to allow us to expand the model as we gain access to new sources and additional archives through collaborations with other institutions and individuals.\r\nAt the outset, it was anticipated that more papers relating to the Peace Process would have been deposited with archives and even digitized, and so would be simply signposted from the Quill model. Instead, much of the first eighteen months of the project have been dedicated to document recovery and digitization. (All documents acquired and scanned during this process have been returned to Ireland to the care of local archives as acquisition of documents has never been the intention of this project.) \r\nWe are now able to make available our first Writing Peace Resource Collections. Several other collections are currently in production, including David Trimble's archive, and we are actively seeking partners to broaden the range of material either hosted by or linked to from the site. Development of the digital models that will visualize these collections is currently underway, and preview access is provided to the earliest models on the Brooke-Mayhew Talks and the Downing Street Declaration. Further models and revisions to the existing models are anticipated in 2025.",

This collection brings together digital collections of archival documents and an interactive timeline of the drafting of the constitution that allows scholars, legal practitioners, teachers, and the general public to understand this foundational document within context.",
    "introduction_text": "Resources on constitution-making have mostly focussed on cases from the global North, notably the US, Europe, and on the role of founding fathers. The role of collective practices of petition, debate, and protest by ordinary citizens and the marginalized in the making of constitutions (and their remaking over time) remains largely invisible.\r\n\r\nA ground-breaking multi-disciplinary research collaboration, PACT presents an advanced digital platform on the making of the Indian constitution (1950), one of the most influential in the global South. The Indian Constituent Assembly (1946-49) met against the background of a transfer of power from British rule, Partition, Hindu-Muslim bloodshed, and the largest mass migration in history. Despite these formidable challenges, as well as deep disagreement among members from diverse religious, caste, and linguistic groups, the Constituent Assembly came to successfully agree on a constitutional text. In the 75th year of Indian independence (2022), the constitution continues to occupy a salient position in contemporary politics.\r\n\r\nOur research will aim to draw lessons regarding the democratic legitimacy of constitutions from the Indian example, while analysing its unfulfilled potential for pluralism and democracy in the present.\r\n\r\nThis model presents an extensive digital record of the proceedings from 1946 to 1949 that led to the formation of the Indian constitution. Alongside these plenary debates of the Indian Constituent Assembly, the model also includes committee discussions, petitions, public responses and the wider debate of the period. This broad collection of sources will allow further study into the context of public opinion against which the Indian constitution was authored.\r\n\r\nPluralist Agreement and Constitutional Transformation (PACT) is an AHRC-funded collaboration among the University of Oxford, SOAS University, the University of York, the National Law School of India, and the Centre for Law & Policy Research.
